I am currently typing on a computer using the keyboard.
The keyboard has a variety of keys, including letters, numbers, and symbols.
My typing skills have improved over time with practice and effort.
English is a widely-used language for communication and information sharing.
Developing good typing skills can help with productivity and efficiency in many tasks.
